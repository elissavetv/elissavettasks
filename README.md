flask app

I made this in order to teach myself how to make flask apps, use SQL and host on Heroku. 
It is a simple Task Log (or task master!). The user can add, modify and delete tasks.

To-do:
Add some CSS to make it look nicer and more user-friendly.

To start me up: 
- Make sure your env is activated locally
- In the terminal, run:  export FLASK_APP=app.py and then flask run.
